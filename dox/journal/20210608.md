### refactoring the promise callback "hell"
async / await does make it cleaner to understand but after making my custom Promise library (PPromise).  

It is probably not  better, it would be interesting / fun to implement some routing with those patterns.

### jest methods
it would be useful if I could provide a "library" of static values to tests that use the same over and over again.  
if the tests methods were namespaced then this would be trivial.
there is a name field in the test methods but those names are not referenceable in the test   but they certainly could 
come from a common source (i.e. a abstracted test definition )

Otherwise, I could have a test class that accepts this configuration in its constructor.
